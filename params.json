If you have tags like `v1.0` Pireis automatically grab them and only show from `x` version _to_ `y` version **differences** seperately. If no tag founds, all by done via commit tags.\r\n\r\n**Note:** This code needs clean-up before gets stable.\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\n    cd myapp\r\n    $ ./pireis.py\r\n\r\n### Options\r\n\r\n* `-f, --format`: Output format (Can be **json** or **md**)\r\n* `-e, --expose`: Expose committer e-mail (If True, e-mail will be included in json/md file otherwise * `NULL`)\r\n* `-s, --signed`: Remove Signed-Off-by: from commits for better look (Strip unnecessary signed off from comments)\r\n* `-x, --extended`: Extended output for Markdown\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\n\r\n    $ ./pireis.py -f json -e -s -x\r\n\r\n**Works on both Windows and Linux.**\r\n\r\n#### Note\r\n\r\nThis is very first release of pireis. I have to do many code cleanup and additions to the core. If you want to contribute, fork it, make changes and request a pull.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
